# The use of this class is detect if there is a pattern present in the graph
# This tracker does not care whether or not access is granted or not, it only 
# cares if the pattern is present

        # If Tracker expects a fresh list each time but internally modifies it, passing a pre-existing list (relationships) could cause unintended side effects.
        # For example, if Tracker modifies self.relationships by appending or removing elements, then the original list (relationships) in your script gets modified as wellâ€”leading to unexpected behavior.
